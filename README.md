# Frameworks Utilized
- SwiftUI
- RealityKit
- FocusEntity
- RealityUI

# How it Works
RealView is an app which allows users to customize and place 3-Dimensional Models of Objects in their real environment and interact with them in innovative ways. The app allows users to move, resize, and rotate objects using intuitive touch-screen gesture input, as well as edit the texture of the object according to the user's preference.

# Tools Utilized:
__Given that this project is a means for me to learn iOS App Development and become acquainted with Swift and SwiftUI, I decided to make this section to document the tools and skills I learn as I implement them in the program.__ <br>

__Views, Stacks, Text, and Images__ <br>
I implemented a basic homepage view with a background color, as well as text, images, and text fields to create a user-interface for prompting the user for inputting data and collecting that data. 

__Algorithms, Computation With Loops, and Buttons__ <br>
I wrote a simple algorithm to parse through characters within an inputted string and shift their ascii value by a given shift amount to perform a basic encryption. I also added buttons to improve the UI.

__Multi-view Configuration with Navigation Links__ <br>
I created separate pages for encryption and decryption, which are navigated to via a central home page. I also created a “help”
page which can be accessed at all times via a constant menu view which appears on each screen.

__MVVM Architecture, App Storage, Binding Variables, Classes, and OOP__ <br>
I created a settings view which is also accessed via the constant menu view, from which default settings such as text field prompts can be altered and saved via the UI by the user.

__DatePicker and Dynamic UI__ <br>
I created a “Time Button” on the constant menu view which, when pressed , displays a view with the current date and time, in a format specified by the user via the settings page.
