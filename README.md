# Downloading
The app is expected to be available for public download access in the near future.

# Frameworks Utilized
- FocusEntity
- RealityKit
- SwiftUI

# How it Works
RealView is an app which allows users to customize and place 3-Dimensional Models of Objects in their real environment and interact with them in innovative ways. The app allows users to move, resize, and rotate objects using intuitive touch-screen gesture input, as well as edit the texture of the object according to the user's preference.

# RoadMap
In the near future, the following implementations and optimizations can be expected for RealView:
- Object placement tracking UI, which provides information to users about location and quantity of placed objects.
- Additional object options, including objects which may be placed on vertical planes.
- Focus Entity customizability allowing users to edit shape, color, etc. of object placement indicator.
- Object deletion
- Additional color options, as well as other material customizability options for objects.
- Implementation of 'RealityUI' framework, via which users will be able to customize objects using intuitive 3-Dimentional UI features in 
  realtime
